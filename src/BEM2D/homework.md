## Homework 1: Curved Mesh
Create a function that creates a mesh for a plate capacitor with curved plates. The function should take the plate length, separation distance, number of elements per plate, and a curvature parameter as input. The curvature parameter should define how much the plates are curved (e.g., radius of curvature). The function should return a `Mesh2D` object representing the curved plates.

## Homework 2: BEM
Can the implementation also handle the curved mesh? Test it and show the results.
If not, what changes are necessary to make it work?
